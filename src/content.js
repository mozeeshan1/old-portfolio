<br/><br/>
With this, the client asked for a location-based tour guide game experience applied to the team's chosen context that fits with exploring culture and society around Glasgow.
<br/><br/>
The game had to run on a mobile device and have short play sessions of 1 to 5 minutes but may have as many sessions to complete the path.`;

<br/><br/>
An example of a feedback concept was to look at the direction of a mural walk. A mural walk is when a person is given a book full of murals located across the region, and they must then go discover the mural and check it off in the book after they find it. Even while the murals themselves were gratifying, these were deemed to be rather dull. The team expanded on this concept by finding suitable landmarks for the tour of Glasgow's culture in terms of relevance and distance. It fulfilled the brief, and the ideation process came to a conclusion.
<br/><br/>
The next step was choosing the monuments and planning a route through all the selected monuments. Two routes were planned based on their total distance.`;

export const p1Para4 = `The Two statues the team focused on for prototyping for the assessment would be The Clyde Clock and Duke of Wellington Statue. They were picked due to their proximity to the university campus and their basic style mechanics, which allowed the team to rapidly evaluate their efficacy in achieving the requirement and offer clear samples of the project if it was to be pushed further.
<br/><br/>
Clyde Clock was chosen as the first monument to be worked upon due to its proximity to the University. The mini-game interaction for Clyde clock involves the clock running away from the screen of the player, which indirectly symbolizes that time is running out.
<br/><br/>
The player is tasked with capturing it by keeping it in the frame while it runs in circles around the player. The gyro sensor determines where the phone is in real-world space when it is moved. The player successfully completes the mini-game by holding the clock on the screen for a set amount of time. By this stage, the map had already been loaded with elements that were essential to the gameplay.`;

Unity was chosen as the game engine as the team had experience using it. After going through multiple concepts, the direction of the story was chosen to lean towards raising awareness for the issues faced by transgendered people and those suffering from body dysmorphia. To add more interactivity to the game, minigames that affect the story would be added throughout the game. The target audience is casual gamers with a basic understanding of puzzles and of at least teenage years (+12) that can understand the intended tones and message of the story which are accepting one’s identity, personal freedom over rigid conformism to authority, and personal growth through one's failure.
<br/><br/>
The plot was discussed more, as it should have both a fun atmosphere while talking about real-world issues such as body dysmorphia through an innocent toy-like figure like LEGO mini-figures.
<br/><br/>
It was agreed that Lego mini-figures will have a protagonist which is relatable and more of a ‘chilled out’ character as opposed to the antagonist figure which when the protagonist starts developing body dysmorphia, the antagonist shoots the protagonist down on it. The antagonist is motivated with keeping the status quo. The human is unaware of this struggle. All of this is more of a metaphor of how society reacts to body dysmorphia, through these characters.`;
